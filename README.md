## Part 2: Let's Make a Bar Chart

[Lab 1 - Tutorial 2](https://cr2007.github.io/F20DV-Lab1/lab1_part2.html)

> Inspect the bar associated with the city Ottawa, is there any problems with it? What could be the reason?

There is a problem with the bar associated with the city Ottawa. The bar is not visible because the height of the bar.<br>
The height for the SVG is set to **500px** and the height of the bar is set to **700px**.<br>
This results in the bar being cut off at the top of the SVG.

### Code
